# Tile38 Webserver
A docker image with a http web server written in Go that routes all http calls to the tile38 server.
The server will check every requests using one of the available methods: jwt (using rsa or hmac) and basic (using a secret)
and only authorized requests will be routed. Since you can only using tile38 AUTH command by a cli interface,
this docker image allows you ensure http calls only come from authorized clients.

# Environment variables

This is an example for the .env file that must be placed inside the data folder.
Note that data folder is a docker volume that must be mounted during container creation.

```
# URI for the tile38 server
# !!IMPORTANT!! DO NOT INCLUDE TRAILING SLASHES
TILE38_URI="http://localhost:1234"
# valid types: jwt_rsa, jwt_hmac and basic
#jwt_rsa and jwt_hmac expect a header Authorization in the form 'Authorization: Bearer jwt_token'
#basic expects a header Authorization in the form 'Authorization: secret'
VALIDATION_TYPE="jwt_rsa"
# VALIDATION_SECRET is required if VALIDATION_TYPE is equal to jwt_hmac or basic
#VALIDATION_SECRET="mysecret"
# List of jwt valid alg values, this is required for security purposes
JWT_VALID_ALG="RS512 RS256"
# Optional: list of jwt valid sub values
#JWT_VALID_SUB="user microservice"
# URI for a RSA Public key pem file used during request validation if VALIDATION_TYPE is jwt_rsa
PUBKEY_URI="https://my.public.key/key.pem"
# Address and port that the server will bind to
SERVER_ADDR="0.0.0.0:4433"
#Server .cert file
#Path is relative to data folder
SERVER_CERT="server.crt"
#Server key file
#Path is relative to data folder
SERVER_KEY="server.key"
# Timeouts are expressed in seconds
SERVER_WRITE_TIMEOUT=15
SERVER_READ_TIMEOUT=15
# Public key cache duration in minutes
CACHE_DURATION=10
```

# Generating server.crt and server.key
This is an example of how to create a self-signed certificate and private key for the server.
The server expects these files to be placed inside the data folder

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1024 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```
